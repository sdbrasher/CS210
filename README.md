# CS210

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
  _-The project's goal was to make a compound interest calculator to show users how their investments can grow with differing monthly deposit amounts._
  
**What did you do particularly well?**
  _-I covered input validation and encapsulation fairly well._
  
**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
  _-The code needs to be enhanced in the logic blocks containing "system("pause");". In my further readings, I have found this is not a secure function call and should be replaced by a different screen clearing logic._
  
**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
  _-At first, I tried to complete the project using linked lists with each node being a month's worth of investment data. After a few days of work and reviewing time and project constraints, I realized that wasn't the most effective way of completing the project and went with variables to track the steadily increasing values of interest earned, closing balance, etc._
  
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
  _-Debugging skills will be incredibly useful in other projects. Though it isn't my first exposure, I do like the concept of encapsulation for both readability and security._  
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  _-My current strategy is to leave "first draft" comments behind as I code a rough draft. As I finalize the program, I expand out my comments to give more detail on related material._
